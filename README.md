 # Hollywood Closet Project: EDA
-  I explored data collected as part of research on LGBT+ experiences in the film and music industries. I contributed to this data collection as a research assistant at UC Davis. 

- This is part of a faculty member's larger project called the Hollywood Closet Project, investigating the nature and reprecussons of coming out of the closet as a celebrity.
